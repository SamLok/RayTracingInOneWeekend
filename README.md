# RayTracingInOneWeekend
Ray Tracing in One Weekend by Peter Shirley

This is a C/C++ implementation of Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing in One Weekend. 
https://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf

The intent for this project is learning and understanding how ray tracing works. Other form of implementation is welcome.
The implementation is all CPU computation with no GPU accelerator.
